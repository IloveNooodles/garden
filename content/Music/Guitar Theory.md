## Strings on Guitar 
In guitar we have 6 scales, usually we can rhymes it with this, it go from the thinniest (bottom/1st) to the thicker (top/6th)

```
e ddie
B ye
G ood
D ynamite
A te
E ddie
```

# Music Notes
Music uses 12 notes, often we have higher than the base, we called it crash (#) or lower than the base, we called it $\beta$ . So A# would be equal to B$\beta$. 
* 1 Fret in guitar would increase 1 semitones (A -> A#)
* B and E doesn't have # version!!!

```
A - A# - B - C - C# - D - D# - E - F - F# - G - G# - A (Higher octave)
```

In piano, this is the major scale formula, in piano, half step = play the next key (white or black)

```
Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half
```


## Building Blocks 

### Scales
Ordered set of notes. Starts from the Character up to 7
* C Major = C D E F G A B
* A Major = A B C D E F G
### Chords
Group of notes (often uses 3+ from a scale) played together

#### Major Chords
Often Use 1st + 3rd + 5th notes of the scale
* C major Scale
	* C (1) + E (3) + G(5)
#### Minor Chords
Often Use 1st + flat 3rd + 5th
* A minor Scale
	* A(1) + C(flat) + E(5)
