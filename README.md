# Gare Digital Garden

> "The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." — Lao Tzu 

## Welcome! |˶˙ᵕ˙ )ﾉﾞ

Hello, my name is Gare, and welcome to my Digital Garden!

## What is This?

This is where I put my messy notes—some people call it a digital garden, others call it a second brain, but it's the same thing! The idea is to capture all of my thoughts in one place so I can revisit them later. I also want to promote learning in public so that not only I can gain knowledge, but others can too!

## About Me

I am a software engineer who likes to try and explore new things ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ). Recently, I got really hooked on [[tags/kubernetes]] and networking. I try to balance my technical knowledge with other hobbies such as photography, knitting, sports, reading books, and I'm currently learning to write.

Nice to meet you, and I hope you enjoy your time here ( ˘͈ ᵕ ˘͈♡)
