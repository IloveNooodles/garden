Monitoring is the action of observing and checking the behaviour and outputs of a system and it's components over time

monitoring is a process to ensure stable operations by tracking performance status and swiftly detecting any issues

## How should we do monitoring?

- Important things for the monitoring
 	- observability
  		- a measure indicating whether the state of the system can be understood and explained regardless of what state the system is in
- Imagine you, as an engineering and become responsible for a particular service

## How can we enhance observability

- Understand the internal structure of application
- Comprehend the system state of the application even when encountering application

### Key of observability

- Metrics
 	- System health status
 	- capruted overtime as time data series
 	- Charcteristic
  		- Numerical and measurable
  		- represent trends and patters in system
  		- Aggregatable
- Logs
 	- text-based records generated by system records and applications
 	- logs capture the history events and provide visibility into the system state
 	- non-distributed events
 	- chronological order is very important
 	- log level
  		- Debug
   			- Provide detail information for debugging system, analyzing root cause for an issue
   			- should be enabled as necessary
  		- Info
   			- Information about basic progress operation of the system
   			- successful events
  		- warning
   			- potential issue, but no actual error failured
  		- error
- Traces
 	- Request scoped distributed events
 	- Data that tracks and visualize the flow of request and processes within system
 	- essential for identifying where delays or errors occur in distributed system or Microservice
 	- display in flamegraph
 	- Char
  		- Logs the flow of request across the entire system
  		- highlight performance bottlenecks and error locs
 	- Collections of spans that have unique ID

# Datadog

## Integrations

have many features to connect with other applications, we can collect metrics, logs and traces events from aws, or other services

## Best practice

 Output structure logs, Output like json or others key values format

## APM (Application Performance Monitoring)

- App that provides deep visibility
- helps monitor trace and troubleshoot
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize application performance
- Compare the current with other
