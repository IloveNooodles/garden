Container

- Container is to bundled everything with it's own library and files
- It helps portability and prevent mistakes

Software engineering is not about programming

- Development
- Deployments
- Development + Operation = Dev Ops

## Problems

- Not application made the same way
- Application are selfish
- Organizational growth become their own bottle neck

## Advent of containerization

- Standardized operations
- Everything in one container
- Separation of concern
- run everywhere
