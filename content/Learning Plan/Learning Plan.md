> Practice and experience. I can tell you the solutions to many problems instantly. Not because I worked it out fast like some genius. Just because I've seen a similar problem before and I remember the approaches taken and whether they worked or not. Just keep trying. First yourself, then looking at other people's solutions to learn the best approach and why it is so. I don't think anybody was born solving complex problems. It's a skill you develop and it takes time.

>You can just focus on the design aspect if you want, but I've never come across jobs that focus solely on this. Front end devs are usually expected to be able to make the front end functional, and this usually means using JS. It's up to you.
