Hello |˶˙ᵕ˙ )ﾉﾞ my name is Gare and welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is where i put my messy notes, some people called it digital garden and some people called it second brain but it's the same thing!. The idea is to put all of my thoughts into a platform so i can look at it later again. I also want to promote learning in public so that not only you can gain knowledge but others too!

I am a software engineer that like to try and explore new things ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ) recently i got really hooked into [[tags/kubernetes]] and networking. I try to balance my knowledge with other hobbies such as photography, knitting, sports, reading books, and currently learning to write.

Nice to meet you and I hope you enjoy your time here ( ˘͈ ᵕ ˘͈♡)
