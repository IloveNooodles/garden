We need to learn so that our fingers doesn't stuck in the strings. You can move the whole hands motion or just the fingers

```
D: Down
U: UP
T: Thumb
1: index finger
```

Flesh will give soft sound and Nail will give upbeat sound. Here are some variation for strumming the guitar

## Variation

### #1 T
* Flesh (D) + Flesh (U)
* Flesh (D) + Nail (U)
### #2 1 (Index)
* Nail (D) + Nail (D) 

### #3 Like holding a pick 
But still use index finger, thumb is not used

### #4 Base note thumb
Use thumb for base note on E (1st) and D (3rd) string
* T - 1 (D) - 1 (U) - T - 1(U) - 1(D)
