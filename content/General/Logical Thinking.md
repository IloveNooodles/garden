# Logical Thinking

## Main Idea

## Recap

1. Clrafify thinking by
1. dig deeper into our thoughts
2. communicate thoughts with clarity
1. identifying what is fact and interpretattion
2. Making clear what is fact and what is interpretation when communicating

## Deepening and organizing our thought

- Why we need to deepen our thoughts
  - Maybe the first thought that pop in your head first not necessesarly the most optimal one
  - Verbalizing your thought is hard
  - If we like outburst thought, it may be confusing for everybody so we need to wait, pause to make it easier to understand
- Summarization Excercise
  - Grouping  to relevant categories
  - Define the category
  - Make sure we have relevant category alignment
  - Limiting/restristing effect ( we don;t want to specific )
  - **WE DON'T NEED TO BE SPECIFIC IN GROUPING**

### Keywords Is Important

- By digging deeper into our thinking we can make language concrete and begin to organize our thoughts

### Seperate Fact from interpretation

- Fact is something known or proven to be true
  - It will be percieved as same with both people
  - Make it easy to see issue and take concerete steps
- Interpretation is understanding of something you heard or saw
  - Involves personal feelings
  - Is it not a bad thing and clrearly useful in data mining / analytics, It makes more difficult

## Pyramid Principal

Why? **Start with conclusion, add support arguments, logical structure**
People have short attention span

This is for communication, for the structuring we can do the reverse order

- Start with main idea
  - This is the conclusion, and start with this
- Group supporting argument
  - Create some supporting argument to follow your idea
  - this is kind of evidence
- Use logical structure
  - Data / facts to support supporting argument

### Horizontal Logic

- MECE, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive
  - No missing information
  - No overlapping information
- Gap is missing information, so you missed some information
  - We basically need to make sure point out all of the possiblity
  - busses
  - train
  - airplane
  - The missing one is
    - combine all other
    - Shinkansen
    - rent a car

### Vertical Logic

Claims that supported by valid reasoning (connected evidence)

Something happen

1. Claim but no evidence

- I can fly

2. Claim but the evidence is not relevant to the claim

- I can fly but run around five times

3. Claim but the evidence is not sufficient

If we provide some paragraph

- We can ask "Why So", after every sentence
- We can asking "So What?" after every sentence
