# QA Activity

- Set quality standards
- process control
- testing
- quality improvement
- establish a quality assurance system
- quality assurance plays

## Testing

Why people make mistakes

- Pressure to deliver
- human make mistakes
- insufficient experience or skills of project participants
- miscommunication among participants
- complextiy, code, design architecture
- misconceptions about interfaces
- new and unfamiiar tech

cost fixing after release is very high
testing is activity to provide new information on quality

### Test pyramid

- Unit
 	- Should be applied to anything that could be broke

- Integration
 -

- E2E

### Overall testing flow

- Test plan
- test analysis
- test design
- test implementation
- test run
- test complete

### Testing techniques

- Equivalence partitioning
 	- Split into groups that yield the same results and select representative values among them as test cases
 	- Ex: form that 1 - 10
  		- Input 5, 0, 11
 	- picking one representative values that available in the range values
 	- consider also valid and invalid value
- Boundary Value analysis
 	- Ex 8 - 16
 	- input are, 7, 8, 16, 17
 	- because people often miss > and >=
- Decision table test
- State transition test
 	- Test whether the software is capable of starting and ending a defined state via a valid or invalid transition

JSTQB FL (Foundation Level)
ISTQB huge truck

- Test is very important to maintain quality
 	- unit
 	- integration
 	- end 2 end
- We learn 4 different test
 	- equivalence partioning
 	- boundary value analysis
 	- decision table
 	- state transition
- We also need to consider business on testing
- We need to make sure we passed all the test to prevent a million yen of failure
